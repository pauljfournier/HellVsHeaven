# HellVsHeaven

*This project is not maintained anymore.*

Hell vs Heaven was a smartphone multiplayer game where three teams fights each other for victory, it was based on real world social interactions and an interface on a smartphone application for the fights and powers. The players have to find each other in a defined area, discuss to find if the other player is an enemies or an ally and eventually fight in consequence. It was heavily inspired by game such as [The Werewolfs of Millers Hollow](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/25821/werewolves-millers-hollow), [Town of Salem](https://www.blankmediagames.com/), [Mafia](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/284209/mafia) and some principles of the mechanics of *Pokemon Go*.

Here is how it happened:
- The creator of the game decided an area in the real world to play and selected it in the game. 
- The players had to be reunited in a small area to meet each other and start the game.
- The game started after few minutes and each player was attributed a role with a fair repartition depending on the number of players.
- The fights and interactions were done in the games and the real world.
    There is a "distance of vision", an area around you to detect the other players on your map.
    There is a "distance of action", an area around you to interact with the other players on your map, mainly attacking to try to kill the other one.
    Except basic demons and basic angels, every role has an additional power that can be decisive for the fights. 
- Once all the demons or all the angels have died, the game is over, the surviving team win, and maybe some neutral characters too.

### Demons 
They have to kill all angels, but only Lucifer designates the victim. If Lucifer is dead or not in the game, the chaos rules, unless some scrounger try to improve its position in the hierachy.

### Neutrals
Due to the neutrals goals been different from the one from Hell or Heaven, multiple players can win during one game.

The creator is not in a good mood, he must kill a third of the player to win.
